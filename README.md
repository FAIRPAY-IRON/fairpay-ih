# FairPay

## Techs

Some of the tools I've used are:

- Node.js
- Express
- Mongodb
- Materialize
- Passport & Bcrypt
 > Google, Facebook & Local authentications
- PayPal API Payments
- Google Maps API
- APIFootball

## What is it about?

Fairpay is simply a social betting platform for football lovers, designed to offer the user security and immediacy. With a FRONT-design mounted on Materialize, while to set the BACK we have relied on Mongodb for databases and Express to manage Nodejs.

In Fairpay you will enjoy the best existing computer security. We have relied on NPM packages such as Passport and Bcrypt to make your account 'hacker-proof'. we have also incorporated APIs such as PayPal, Google Maps and APIFootball to improve the user experience.
